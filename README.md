- 👋 Hi, I’m @JasenNemeth
- 👀 I’m interested in learning coding and being well-rounded in all areas.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, JS via freeCodeCamp. I'm also interested in Python!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my projects as I work thru the curriculum. 
- I also have some ideas for Python projects using Anvil, but wanted to invest the time building a better coding foundation first. 
- 📫 How to reach me: jasennemeth@gmail.com
